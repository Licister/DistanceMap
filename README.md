#Distance Map

##README

This is the source code for the Distance Map app found [here](http://licister.shinyapps.io/distancemap), created for the ["Developing Data Products"](https://www.coursera.org/course/devdataprod) course project.


Distance Map is an application that takes two American cities as inputs (from a selection of 10), and returns the straight line distance between them in miles and kilometers. It also adds two markers on a map to let the user know where the cities are located.



The page should look like the sample image in the [sample-image](/DistanceMap/sample-image/) folder. If it does not look like this, please let me know.




Data set used: [UScitiesD](http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/eurodist.html), available from the base R installation.



Coordinates of the cities retrieved from [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com).


Libraries used: [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) and [rCharts](http://rcharts.io/).


CSS theme used: [Darkly] (http://bootswatch.com/darkly/).
